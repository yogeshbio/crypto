Symmetric cryptography is further divided as Block and Stream cipher. Block cipher: Works on blocks of data and slower than stream cipher. It uses math operations such as Substituition and Transposition of elements E.g. DES, 3DES, AES Stream cipher: Works on stream of data either 1 bit or 8 bit and is much faster","title":"Cryptography_Basics"}]}
